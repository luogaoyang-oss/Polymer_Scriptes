# Polymer_Scriptes
This repository provides scripts for studying polymer structure-property relationships using machine learning and simulations. It includes tools for high-throughput screening, property prediction (e.g., Tg, mechanical properties), molecular dynamics analysis, and data visualization. Contributions are welcome!
